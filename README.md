# hello-http

###HTTP Server
This API creates an HTTP server that will return a greeting to the user at a specific path. If the user puts in a request to head to 'localhost:3000/greeting/user', the API will return 'hello user'. 'Hello' is the deafault greeting. 
You can also create your own greeting by using a query, for example: 'localhost:3000/greeting/user?salutation=yo' will return 'yo user'.

It will also return random facts about HTTP if the user goes to the route '/fact'
