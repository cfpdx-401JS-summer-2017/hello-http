# Hello HTTP

### An exercise from Code Fellows PDX Summer 2017 Code 401 class
### Completed by Joe Churchman

This lab is an exercise in getting acquainted with http methods and paths.

In order to use this code, simply clone it down to your machine and open a terminal window.
From there, start the server by running the server file via node.
If you're running on Node.js you can do this by navigating to the cloned folder
and entering the command node server.js

Once you have done that, you can open a browser window to localhost:3000 and interact with this app.

You can submit GET requests to the /greeting or /fact paths.

/greeting can be augmented by adding a /name and even a query to the salutation ?salutation=hey there

Directing to the /fact path will return a random fact about HTTP.

Enjoy!
